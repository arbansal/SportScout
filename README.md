# Welcome to SportScout!

SportScout is an online community to assist individuals and groups to pursue their passion towards sports.
We plan to accomplish this by making use of user interactions, online discussion boards and scheduling, while providing the users the flexibility to choose what they want, who they want and when they want.

There are 3 types of users our website caters to:
1. Players (or Seekers): Who are general people looking for other players, trainers, tournaments and venues around them 
2. Trainers: Who are certified experts trying to provide servcies at a price
3. Managers (or Providers): Who are verified hosts of the venue or the tournament

Our platform strives to make the life of a sports enthusiast easier by leveraging the power of the internet and creating a community of trained experts and inexperienced sports professionals who can help each other, irrespective of their age, gender, location or level of
expertise. The idea is to create an online community using which we can assist individuals and groups who are currently unable to pursue their passion towards sports either due to unavailability of courts, turfs, or fields in their vicinity, or being unable to find buddies with whom they can explore and share their interest, or merely due to lack of information or opportunity. It also targets providers and organizations who are willing to rent out their spaces and services, or those who are interested in hosting an event and generating revenue through advertisements, sponsorship and mass participation. The website allows them to do all of this, at the comfort of their homes!
